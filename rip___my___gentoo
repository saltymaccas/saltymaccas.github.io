Today I lost someone special to me, someone who neutured and raised me, someone who showed me a world and and never once held back my freedom.
They did drive me insane sometimes, 
They brought me to fights that I could've never foreseen  myself in, 
They took my time as if I had a few trees out the back that grew it
But in retrospect, I loved that.

Though most of all, they were with me, always. The only distro in my 4 years of linux experience that could last more than 3 months. They stood with me for 1 and a half years.

May each tear that rolls down my face every time i accedently write "emerge" instead of "pacman" bless you on your greater journeys.

now i run endeavouros, which just feels like a shell of you.

I'm writing this in nano right now out of respect for you. Only having including nano in your iso's and not vim or vi was one of your unique traits.

you fill forever have a small place in my heart.

I'm going to sleep now. I hope our path converge once again <3
